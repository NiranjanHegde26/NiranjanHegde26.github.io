Hello there! I'm Niranjana Hegde Bhimanakone Satyanarayana (Phew! Very long name, I know!) but you can call me Niranjan (n̪iɾɐnd͡ʒɐn̪). I'm a Masters student in [Language Science and Technology](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst/about-us.html) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), Germany. Alongside my studies, I work as a [student assitant](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg.html) under [Prof. Dr. Vera Demberg](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg/members/verademberg.html).
