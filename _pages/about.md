Hello there! I'm Niranjana Hegde Bhimanakone Satyanarayana (Phew! Very long name, I know!) but you can call me Niranjan (n̪iɾɐnd͡ʒɐn̪). I'm a Masters student in [Language Science and Technology](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst/about-us.html) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), Germany. Alongside my studies, I work as a [student assitant](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg.html) under [Prof. Dr. Vera Demberg](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg/members/verademberg.html).

Although my broad range of interests are in psycholinguistics, computational psycholinguistics, langauge acquisition, language and memory and consciousness, I am eager to work more on the lexical and semantic representations in humans and the interplay between them and the memory. You can check some of the papers I wrote for my curriculum on similar topics in "projects" section.

In my free time, I am busy being an amaetuer photographer; writing poetries, short stories; watching soccer; reading crime, mystery, suspense, detective thrillers or psychological thriller novels (although my current obsessions are science non-fiction books) or bingewatching TV shows or movies of the aforementioned genres. You can check my photography in Unsplash. I often write prose, poetries based on my photographs and you can check it here in my Instagram account! Most of my writings are in my mother tongue, Kannada (A Dravidian language from South India).
